"# SuperCoolProject" 
The SuperCoolProject is a proposal for a website which preppares people for the apocolypse!!!
It will comprise of 6 pages: 
1. Home - home page, feels homely
2. About - explains the purpose (sounds cool, and to act as a survival guide)
3. Shopping List - Purchase accessories (such as chainsaws and beer)
4. Wasteland Survival Guide - Explains what to do in such an event
5. Why we exist? - explains why we exist (sounds cool ig)
6. Chat Forum - for chatting to fellow enthusiasts

Quite simple, inspired by a video I saw about making a website based on Y2K (I wasn't even born lol) and remember no actual coding is required
Lastly, ignore the 'master' branch, it is just an example of code submitted on intelliJ, just so I got the hang  of it...
