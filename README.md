This branch was merely to try pushing some code onto github via intelliJ, as such I apologise for the confusion, being that there is a 'master' AND a 'main' branch.
I am not entirely sure what I did to create this branch, but given that these days GH defaults to having a main, I suspect what has happened is it was created automatically by IntelliJ
The actual project will be carried out on the 'main' branch. 
Sorry again - Angus
