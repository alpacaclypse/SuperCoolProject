Chat Forum

Quite a simple idea, a chat forum. Of course in the even of an apocalypse, the chances are the forum wouldn't likely stay up, so the main purpose is to establish a sense of community on our site, so people can share ideas and ask questions as such.

Ideally, it would allow for chatrooms, direct messaging, blogs and more. In fact this idea is so cool I might make it in real life :)
