Why We Exist

This is the "about me" page every website insists upon its users. 

Likely this will just be a block of text as such:

"It may be today, it may be tomorrow, it may be in a thousand years, but one thing is certain! Total annihilation of mankind!
Mankind's greatest desire is to create and innovate. In doing so we have achieved brilliant reaches, yet terrible outcomes."

In truth I'd probably get chatGPT to write something better (maybe some ironic jargon about an AI overlord situation).

Anyway, not that I believe that any of this is actually true, it's just a bit of fun....

(The shop wouldn't actually take money either, maybe I'd make a bottlecap currency which you can earn by engaging on the forum)
